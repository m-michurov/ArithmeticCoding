The first column contains cumulative probabilities following top to bottom in the same order as they follow in the message. They are multiplied by probabilities for all previous symbols in a message. The index starts from 1. To obtain result we have to compute products of cofactors in every row and then find the sum of them. I call this visual tool ARCOD pyramid.
